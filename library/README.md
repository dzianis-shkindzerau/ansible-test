# Bundling Ansible Modules With Playbooks

If a playbook has a ”./library” directory relative to its YAML file, this directory can be used to add ansible modules that will automatically be in the ansible module path. 
This is a great way to keep modules that go with a playbook together. 
This is shown in the directory structure example at the start of this section.
